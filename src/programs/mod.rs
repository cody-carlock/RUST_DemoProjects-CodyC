/*
Module & all submodules written by Cody C.

This module includes programs intended to demonstrate my understanding of program development.
It also demonstrates my ability to adapt, learn, and overcome any challenge I face.

My previous experience in programming exclusively includes languages like Java, Python, C#, and LUA and, as such, Demo1 is the first program I have ever written in RUST.
Demo programs are written in order on a timeline, with dates included in the header. If a program is revised in the future, it will be noted in the header. The initial program will still be visible via Git history.
This means that each demo program is written in order of least to most experience; For example, Demo1 is my first time writing in RUST, however, Demo8 would be written much later on, meaning I will have significantly more experience.
